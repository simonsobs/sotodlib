# NOTE: eventually add test steps for documentation build and MPI tests.  If the
# commands to run inside the container become too complicated they should be moved to
# scripts.  We could also just modify the user permissions when volume mounting the
# source checkout, rather than making a copy inside the container for running the tests.
