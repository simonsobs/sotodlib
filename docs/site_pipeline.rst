.. py:module:: sotodlib.site_pipeline

=============
site_pipeline
=============

The site_pipeline submodule contains programs supporting
quick-turnaround data processing at the observatory.

.. note::

  Documentation of interfaces is currently held separately.  The focus
  here will be on operation; command line parameters and config file
  syntax.


Pipeline Elements
=================

update-g3tsmurf-db
-------------------

This script set up to create and maintain g3tsmurf databases. :ref:`See details
here<g3tsmurf-update-section>`.

imprinter
----------

This script is designed to help with the bookbinding. It will search a given
Level 2 G3tSmurf database for observations that overlap in time. The different
optional arguments will let us pass information from something like the sorunlib
database to further filter the observations. 

Currently outputs a list of tuples where each tuple is one or more observation
ids. Each tuple has at least some overlap.

.. argparse::
   :module: sotodlib.site_pipeline.imprinter
   :func: get_parser


Detector and Readout ID Mapping
-------------------------------

These processes are interrelated and use a combination of the DetMap software
package and sotodlib. The two scripts below are designed to use the same config
files for simplicity and can be run with the level 2 G3tSmurf setup. The
resulting ManifestDbs should work for both level 2 and level 3 SMuRf data. 

make_det_info_wafer
```````````````````
This script uses the DetMap software package to build detector IDs for a set of
UFMs and save them in a ManifestDb / HDF5 file. The formatting of the ResultSet 
saved in HDF5 file will map all this information into ``det_info.wafer`` when used 
with a correctly formatted context file and a readout to detector id mapping.
The detector info mapping created by this script will be stable as long as the
same UFMs are used in the same optics tube positions, meaning it only needs to
be re-made if the physical hardware setup changes. 

make_read_det_match
```````````````````
This script generates the readout ID to detector ID mapping required to
translate between the detector hardware information (ex: pixel position) and the
readout IDs of the resonators used to index the SMuRF data. The script uses the 
G3tSmurf database to generate a list of TuneSets (tune files) for a set of
arrays / stream ids and runs the DetMap mapping software to generate a mapping
between detectors and resonators. The saved metadata is formatted so with the
correctly formatted Context file the detector ids can be automatically loaded in
the ``det_info`` AxisManager.

Config file format
``````````````````
Here's an example configuration file. Many of these values depend on hardware
setup and readout software setup. Making the detector ID info only requires a
subset of these parameters but the processes are linked so it is probably worth
always having the same configuration file.

.. code-block:: yaml

    data_prefix : "/path/to/level2/data/"
    g3tsmurf_db: "/path/to/g3tsmurf.db"
    read_db: "/path/to/readout_2_detector_manifest.db"
    read_info: "/path/to/readout_2_detector_hdf5.h5"
    det_db : "/path/to/det_info/wafer/manifest.db"
    det_info : "/path/to/det_info/wafer/hdf5.h5"

    arrays:
      # name must match DetMap array names
      - name: "Cv4"
        stream_id: "ufm_cv4"
        # Based on hardware config
        north_is_highband: False
        dark_bias_lines: []
        # how we want to call DetMap
        mapping :
          version : 0
          strategy: "map_by_freq"
          # parameters for mapping strategy
          params: {
            "output_parent_dir":"/writable/path/",
            "do_csv_output": False,
            "verbose": False,
            "save_layout_plot": False,
            "show_layout_plot": False,
            }

Context file format
```````````````````
To load these metadata with context, these entries must be part of the context
file. Since the detector hardware information loads off of the ``det_id`` field,
which is loaded from the readout to detector mapping, the order of the metadata 
entries mater.

.. code-block:: yaml
    
    imports:
      - sotodlib.io.load_smurf
      - sotodlib.io.metadata

    obs_loader_type: 'g3tsmurf'

    metadata:
        - db: "/path/to/readout_2_detector_manifest.db"
          det_info: true
          det_key: "dets:readout_id"
        - db: "/path/to/det_info/wafer/manifest.db"
          det_info: true
          det_key: "dets:det_id"
