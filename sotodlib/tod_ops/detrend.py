        into the axis manager. Generally intended for use before filter.
        Using this with method ='mean' and axis_name='dets' will remove a 
        common mode from the detectors
        Using this with method ='median' and axis_name='dets' will remove a 
        common mode from the detectors with the median rather than the mean
    
    Arguments:
    
        tod: axis manager
    
        method: method of detrending can be 'linear', 'mean', or median
        
        axis_name: the axis along which to detrend. default is 'samps'
        
        signal_name: the name of the signal to detrend. defaults to 'signal'.
            Can have any shape as long as axis_name can be resolved.

        count: Number of samples to use, on each end, when measuring
            mean level for 'linear' detrend.  Values larger than 1
            suppress the influence of white noise.

    Returns:
        
        detrended signal: does not actually detrend the data in the axis
            manager, let's you decide if you want to do that.
