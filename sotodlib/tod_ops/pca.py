    """Convert a PCA decomposition into the signal basis, i.e. into
    time-dependent modes that one might use for cleaning or
    calibrating.

    The generalization of "common mode" computation is to convert the
    eigen-decomposition of the covariance matrix into a limited set of
    modes that explain a high fraction of the power in the input
    signals.

    Here we select the strongest eigenmodes from the PCA and compute
    the time-dependent modes and the projection of each detector
    signal onto each mode.  An approximation for the input signal may
    then be computed as

       signal_model = weights . modes

    where weights has shape (dets, eigen), modes has shape (eigen,
    samps), and . indicates matrix multipliaction.  The size of the
    eigen axis can be as large as the number of dets, but is typically
    smaller and in this routine is set by n_modes.

    Arguments:
        tod: AxisManager with dets and samps axes.
        pca: AxisManager holding a PCA decomposition, as returned by
            get_pca.  If not specified, it will be computed from the
            data.
        n_modes: integer specifying the number of modes to compute;
            the strongest modes are taken and this sets the size of
            the "eigen" axis in the output.  Defaults to len(dets),
            but beware that the resulting data object will be the same
            size as the input signal.
        signal: array of shape (dets, samps) that is used to construct
            the requested eigen modes.  If pca is not passed in, this
            signal is also used to compute the covariance for PCA.
        wrap: string; if specified then the returned result is also
            stored in tod under that name.

    Returns:
        An AxisManager with (dets, eigen, samps) axes.  The field
