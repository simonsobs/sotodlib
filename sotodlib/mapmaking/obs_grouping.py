"""
This submodule intends to produce a obslist dictionary that will be feed to
a mapmaker. Every element/key of obslist will be mapped as an individual
map. For example, we could request depth-1 maps which are continous scans
one after the other that will be mapped together, we could request per-obs
which will be individual observations mapped individually, etc. See the main
interface function build_obslists for more information and definitions. An
obslist is a dictionary where each element is a list of
(obs_id,detset,band,index) to be mapped. index maps to the list of individual
obs. For example, an atomic map will be a single id, a depth-1 map will be
multiple ids. The keys of the obslist will be (pid,detset,band). Here pid
maps into the periods list, which is simply the periods ranges that will be
mapped. For example, for atomic maps these periods will be simply the ctimes
dividing individual obs, for depth-1 maps it will be the ctimes dividing
depth-1 maps, etc.
