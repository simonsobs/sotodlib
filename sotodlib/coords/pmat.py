class P:
    """Projection Matrix.

    This class provides functions to apply a Projection Matrix (or its
    transpose).  The Projection Matrix, P, also sometimes called the
    Pointing Matrix, describes how a vector of time-ordered
    measurements d are determined by a vector of map pixels m::

      d = P m

    We are working in aspace, of course, where d is not a vector, but
    rather an array of vectors, and m is not a vector, it's a
    multi-dimensional array with two of the dimensions corresponding
    to a rectangular pixelization of the sky.

    If you are making filter+bin maps, you will want to use these functions:

    - to_map
    - to_inverse_weights
    - remove_weights

    If you are solving for a map iteratively you will probably just need:

    - to_map
    - from_map

    Important keyword arguments that are used in many functions:

    - tod: The AxisManager from which signal and pointing information
      should be taken.
    - signal: The array to use for time-ordered signal.  If a string,
      it will be looked up in tod.  Defaults to 'signal'.
    - det_weights: A vector of floats representing the inverse
      variance of each detector, under the assumption of white noise.
    - cuts: A RangesMatrix that identifies samples that should be
      excluded from projection operations.
    - comps: the component code (e.g. 'T', 'TQU', 'QU', ...) that
      specifies the spin-components being modeled in the map.
    - dest: the appropriately shaped array in which to place the
      computed result (as an alternative to allocating a new object to
      store the result).

    Note that in the case of det_weights and cuts, the Projection
    Matrix may also have cached values for those.  It is an error to
    pass either of these as a keyword argument to a projection routine
    if a value has been cached for it.

    Objects of this class cache certain pre-computed information (such
    as the rotation taking boresight coordinates to celestial
    coordinates) and certain context-dependent settings (such as a map
    shape, WCS, and spin-component configuration).  You may want to
    inspect or borrow these results, perhaps to reuse them when
    constructing new instances with slight modifications.  The cached
    attributes are:

    - sight: A CelestialSightLine, representing the boresight pointing
      in celestial coordinates. [samps]
    - fp: G3VectorQuat representing the focal plane offsets of each
      detector. When constructing with a tod argument, fp can be
      automatically populated from tod.focal_plane; note that if hwp
      is passed as True then the gamma (polarization) angles will be
      reflected (gamma' = -gamma). [dets]
    - geom: The target map geometry. This is a pixell.enmap.Geometry
      object, with attributes .shape and .wcs; or possibly (if tiled)
      a pixell.tilemap.TileGeometry.
    - comps: String indicating the spin-components to include in maps.
      E.g., 'T', 'QU', 'TQU'.
    - rot: quat giving an additional fixed rotation to apply to get
      from boresight to celestial coordinates.  Not for long...
    - cuts (optional): RangesMatrix indicating what samples to exclude
      from projection operations (the indicated samples have
      projection matrix element 0 in all components). [dets, samps]
    - threads (optional): list of RangesMatrix objects, to control the
      use of threads in TOD-to-map operations using OpenMP.  See so3g
      documentation. [[threads, dets, samps], ...]
    - det_weights (optional): weights (one per detector) to apply to
      time-ordered data when binning a map (and also when binning a
      weights matrix).  [dets]
    - interpol (optional): How to interpolate the values for samples
      between pixel centers. Forwarded to Projectionist. Valid
      options are:

      - None, 'nn' or 'nearest': Standard nearest neighbor mapmaking.
      - 'lin' or 'bilinear': Linearly interpolate between the four
        closest pixels.

      Default: None

    These things can be updated freely, with the following caveats:

    - If the number of "samples" or "detectors" is changed in one
      attribute, it will need to be changed in the others to match.
    - The threads attribute, if in use, needs to be recomputed if
      anything about the pointing changes (this includes map geometry
      but does not include map components).

    Setting the "threads" argument to certain special values will
    activate different thread assignment algorithms:

    - False: do not use threading; to_map projections will be
      single-threaded.
    - True: use the default algorithm, 'domdir'.
    - None: same as True.
    - 'simple': compute self.threads using simple map-stripe
      algorithm.
    - 'domdir': compute self.threads using dominant-direction
      algorithm (recommended).
    - 'tiles': for tiled geometries, design self.threads such that
      each tile is assigned to a single thread (each thread may be in
      charge of multiple tiles).
